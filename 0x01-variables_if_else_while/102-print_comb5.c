/**
 * main - Prog that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

 * The numbers should range from 0 to 99.
 * The two numbers should be separated by a space.
 * All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01.
 * The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space.
 * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order.
 * 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the nums 0 and 1.
 * You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf,

 * You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code.
 * You are not allowed to use any variable of type char.
 * All your code should be in the main function.
